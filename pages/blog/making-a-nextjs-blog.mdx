# Making a Nextjs Blog using MDX and Styled Components

<Sub>{meta.date}</Sub>{" "}

Initially I set out to learn just styled components, but after diving a little deeper
into what was possible I wanted to use the styled components in a markdown blog.
Since I primarily work in a React environment MDX was the clear front runner for
my markdown engine.

## What is MDX and why use it?

MDX is markdown, but with more. It has the ability to process an imported React component directly into your markdown. This can be useful if you take advantage of this. You can import your contact component in your footer, or a sign up component for your blog. Of course, there are endless possibilities with this, for more information, I highly recommend checking the docs [here](https://mdxjs.com/).

Previously I wanted to use markdown for a blog, but it can quickly become a headache trying to incorporate it with my JSX. However, MDX does a great job taking care of that, being able to put JSX directly into the markdown file eliminated any problems I had.

One thing to note when using MDX with Nextjs you will need a next.config.js file in your root to configure some options to handle the MDX. You will also need the right npm packages to get things going. First start with the packages. I won't go into each of them but they are useful in thier own way.

- \- [@mdx-js/loader](https://npmjs.com/package/@mdx-js/loader)
- \- [@mdx-js/react](https://npmjs.com/package/@mdx-js/react)
- \- [@next/mdx](https://npmjs.com/package/@next/mdx)

Optionally I used prism for my markdown renderer but you wont need that, you can go with your own.

```
npm i --save @mdx-js/react @mdx-js/loader @next/mdx
```

And this next.config.json should get you up and going also.

```
const withMDX = require("@next/mdx")();

module.exports = withMDX({
  pageExtensions: ["js", "mdx"],
});
```

## Using MDX with your Styled Components

Since we are using markdown for the blog posts, the components will need to be styled. Styled Components seemed to be the obvious choice right? Getting set up is fairly easy using Nextjs, but there are some NextJs + Styled Components only things you have to take care of before you start. Just like with MDX some packages are needed.

- \- [styled-components](https://npmjs.com/package/stlyed-components)
- \- [babel-plugin-styled-components](https://npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-styled-components)
- \- [prism-react-renderer](https://npmjs.com/package/prism-react-renderer) - NOTE: this is what i used for syntax highlighting in my `code` and `pre` elements coming from my MDX files.

```
npm i --save styled-components babel-plugin-styled-components prism-react-renderer
```

Once these are installed, you will need another config file, this time for babel. Make a .babelrc file and paste in this. It tells babel what files to look for.

```
{
  "presets": ["next/babel"],
  "plugins": [["styled-components", { "ssr": true }]]
}
```

That should be all to get going for mdx. Just use the .mdx file extension for your markdown files. Next we will go over styling your mdx files.

## Prism-react-renderer

For those wanting to make your own code block sections you'll need to make a custom styled Code.js component. You can copy and paste this example from their docs. We will later use this file in a Post.js component to configure our styled-components with MDX. Sounds a little complicated but it will make sense in the end.

```
import Highlight, { defaultProps } from "prism-react-renderer";

export default function Code({ children }) {
  return (
    <Highlight
      {...defaultProps}
      code={children}
      // Default language of javascript here
      language='javascript'
    >
      {({ className, style, tokens, getLineProps, getTokenProps }) => (
        <pre
          className={className}
          style={{
            ...style,
            // Custom styles go here
          }}
        >
          {tokens.map((line, i) => (
            <div key={i} {...getLineProps({ line, key: i })}>
              {line.map((token, key) => (
                <span key={key} {...getTokenProps({ token, key })} />
              ))}
            </div>
          ))}
        </pre>
      )}
    </Highlight>
  );
}
```

Prism-react-renderer actually has some nice default themes, but you can make your own or just use one of thiers. Personally I like the vsDark theme since my editor closely resembles it.

Once you have a Code.js file you'll need to pass this to your MDXProvider.

Here is my example, using a few custom components in a _Post file_ I will later put in my MDX files.

```
import { MDXProvider } from "@mdx-js/react";
import BlogContainer from "@/components/elements/BlogContainer";
import Code from "@/components/elements/Code";
import H1 from "@/components/elements/H1";
import H2 from "@/components/elements/H2";
import Ul from "@/components/elements/Ul";
import A from "@/components/elements/A";
import Paragraph from "@/components/elements/Paragraph";
import Layout from "./Layout";

const components = {
  h1: H1,
  h2: H2,
  p: Paragraph,
  code: Code,
  a: A,
  ul: Ul,
};

export default function Post({ children }) {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <BlogContainer>
        <MDXProvider components={components}>{children}</MDXProvider>
      </BlogContainer>
    </Layout>
  );
}
```

All element components are styled components exported out of thier own files, and the BlogContainer is used for spacing and margin. just make a _components_ object and pass the element you want to change as the key, and the styled component as the value. Finally pass the components as a components prop to your provider.

Now to wrap it all together, add this before your Markdown in your MDX and let the magic happen.

```
import Post from "@/components/Post";

export default ({ children }) => <Post>{children}</Post>;

# Some Example Markdown title
```

Sorry for the long code heavy read, but hopefully this will help get your blog up and running. You can see this code at my [github](https://github.com/DevLikeMike) under my portfolio repo. Happy Coding.
